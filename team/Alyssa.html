<h1>HI! - Alyssa</h1>
<h3>Here's a sample of my writing. It was a school project.</h3>
  <p>“Do you want any orange juice?” Jay says from behind me, flicking the plastic gallon of ‘Organic Orange Juice’ in his hand. He pushes some black hair from his face and continues drinking it. 
    <p>I turn around, rolling over onto my stomach in an attempt to ignore him. The slate-gray plush couch absorbs my weight, and I sink a few inches.</p> 
  <p>He’s about to say more before he falls into a coughing fit. Orange juice is the most prized thing in creation to Jay. Choking on it can only mean something serious.</p> 
  <p>I whip around and stare at him. “What’s going on?”</p>
<p>He wipes his mouth with the sleeve of his white blouse before answering. “Cyren.” The word takes a few seconds to sink in. Great timing.</p>
<p>“You’ve got to be kidding me.” I sigh and grab the nearest thing I can use for self defense- which turns out to be a pillow. “Why don’t we have any thing useful in this-” Suddenly, Jay tackles me to the ground, sending us skidding across the wooden planks. The glass window we were in front of seconds ago shatters, and the glass flies everywhere, bouncing across the floor in varied sizes. Close call.
  “Get off me.” I snarl, kicking Jay’s 7’1 frame off of my body and standing up.</p>
  <p>“Mind-reading helps, doesn’t it?” Telekinetic-telepathic showoff.</p> 
  <p>I direct my focus to the figure standing in the window frame. Her electric-blue eyed gaze bores into mine. Cyren. She’s holding a black sword hilt in each hand, and platinum katana blades slide out with a metallic sound. They’re ready to use. On us. The bright, neon blue glow shining from the seams of her black, steel, mechanical prosthetic arm illuminates her face. It’s covered with a black cloth mask, so you can only see the upper third of it; her short, black-and-electric-blue-dyed hair- and her eyes. The only things that straight-out tell you you’re not looking at someone else. The things that tell you: That’s Cyren. You’ll either die, or you won’t. Sweet dreams, children. Cyren steps out of the window frame to face us.
She turns her head to look at the inside of our condominium, not taking her eyes off us. Jay bought it by influencing people with telepathy- aaaaaaaand pieces of paper. “When was this all yours?” She says. Her voice is like a knife on water. Smooth- but dangerous. “You should have nothing.”</p>
  <p>“Sounds nice.” Jay says, shrugging. “But not… you know- right now.”</p> 
  <p>I step back and stuff my right hand in the pocket of my faded orange sweatshirt, finding a combination of disappointment- and nothing. This isn’t working as planned. Like I had a plan anyway.</p>
  <p><i>Are you gonna do anything?</i> Jay’s voice says- telepathically- in my head.</p>
<p>I internally roll my eye(I lost my right one due to a certain childhood incident). <i>I thought you had an idea or something, you-</i></p> 
  <p>A fridge flying in front of us and crashing down into a wall snaps me back into the present. I whip around, and sure enough, Cyren appears in a cloud of black mist. Did I mention the highly dangerous fact that she’s a teleporter?
“Shields won’t help, you know.” Cyren says, looking severely disappointed. She curves some hair from her face with her left hand and disappears again. 
    <p>I immediately position myself behind Jay(Who sniggers obnoxiously as I do so), due to Cyren’s unnerving habit of impaling people through their backs. I quickly glance around the room. Behind us is the grey couch positioned in front of the large Samsung television, and before us is the curved granite counter and the two metal stools that go with it. Their surfaces are carpeted in shards of glass. What’s particularly annoying is the broken window. Sunlight is beaming through it in a constant stream, practically lighting up the entire floor. And making it extremely hard to see.</p>
<p>“Looking for something?” Cyren says, appearing next to me. She loops her leg around and delivers a kick to my stomach, knocking the air out of my lungs and sending me crashing into the counter.</p> 
  <p>I roll over onto my stomach, my shoulders and back aching from the impact. Cyren turns toward me. I know she’s grinning behind that mask. I carefully pull myself up and face her, waiting for something to-<p/> 
  <p>A stainless steel frying pan lifts off the counter, streaking through the air and smashing into the side of Cyren’s head. She staggers backward, righting herself. She raises her right arm to touch the right side of her head and lowers it again to look at it, her expression unreadable. Her hand is covered in dark blood. Okay, Jay. Now you’ve done it. Good luck! Cyren turns around to face him, and he backs away a little with his hands up.</p>
<p>“Honestly, I didn’t really mean for it to hit you that har-” Jay slides onto the ground before finishing, narrowly missing the platinum blade of one of Cyren’s weapons and flopping onto the couch instead. “Nice one.”</p> 
  <p>Cyren teleports again, this time reappearing on the counter behind me. I whip around and throw myself at her, colliding and feeling us hit the grass and dirt outside. I can already feel the hot sun on my clothing, the heat burning through and warming my body at an uncomfortable temperature. I sit up, kneeling and pressing my weight down on Cyren’s body as hard as I can to pin her down. That’s when I realize her hands are clamped in a choke hold on my neck.</p>
<p>“Nice try.” She says, sliding out beneath me. I grab both of her arms, the cold steel of her prosthetic shocking my right hand. I try pulling them off of my throat, but she just squeezes harder, making my vision go black at the edges. The pain is unbearable, and I have to bite my tongue to keep myself from crying out. The metallic taste of blood soon fills my mouth.</p>
<p>“Oh, hi guys! I thought you wer- Oh.” Jay says from behind us, causing Cyren to whip her head around, giving me a chance to twist and land a kick on her stomach. She teleports, appearing behind Jay, who backs away a little and continues stalling while I try to regulate my breathing a bit. “As I was saying-” He ducks as Cyren takes a swing at him with one of her katanas. “I thought you guys were having a fun, civilized conversation. Apparently not, I guess." I get up, leaning against the wall as quietly as I can.</p>
  <p><i>Well, at least you got the idea...</i> Jay says telepathically, glancing at me for a second before continuing to make one-sided conversation with Cyren. Right. I ignore him, picking up a particularly long glass shard and hurling it at Cyren. She turns around just in time for it to bounce off of her steel arm. I silently curse to myself. What a lame throw.</p>
<p>“You want it now, do you?” Cyren says, disappearing again. I’m about to turn around when an arm hooks itself around my neck in a headlock. My first instinct is to wrench it off, but I stop myself when I feel the hilt of Cyren’s katana on my back. “Death is beautiful, you know.” I can hear her breathing behind me. “See you on the other side.”</p>
<h1> Now, here is a theory I have about black holes.</h1>
  <p>I used to think that if you were sucked into a black hole and weren't killed immediately by the passing through the event horizon and getting stretched apart after that, the space-time continuum would be manipulated and that you'd be brought back in time to an earlier part in your life and that you'd be forever condemned to living your life over and over again because you'd eventually get sucked into the black hole again. But, I realized that a black hole isn't exactly a portal to your past. It can bend light and manipulate time, but it can't necessarily physically move your body back into its past position along with your memories. Also, time is an illusion. Time was a concept invented by human beings long ago to help them understand the movements of the earth around them. The present is also an illusion. This is proven because you can't measure the present in a length of time. The present lasts for an infinitely short amount of time, so it doesn't exist. The only things that exist are the past and the future. Also, our brains don't really perceive the world as it is- this is because our brains just make sense of the information coming from our eyes- which is not always correct. If you don't yet understand where I'm going with this, what I theorize is that because black holes have the ability to bend light- so they can create an image or series of images that give the illusion that we are living in the past, although we are in fact inside whatever entity a black hole is, and will eventually starve to death if we don't run out of oxygen first.</p>
